## Rules
- You have 3 heroes on your side against a Fire Dragon.
- Click the ROLL! button to roll the slot machine.
- If you get a combination of 3 tiles, the tile action will be performed.
- The Wild Card allows combination with any of the other tiles.
- Beware of the Claw Attack tile. It'll cause one of your heroes damage.
- After each roll, the dragon charges his fire attack a bit. Once it's reached 100%, all heroes will receive the attack.
- Once one hero is dead, the tiles related to the hero skills can no longer perform its actions.
- You can click/tap a tile to lock it for the next round. This costs $1 per locked tile. Rolling or clicking on it again, makes the tile unlock.
- Get a sequence of chests and get more money.
(soon, more rules regarding the money in-game)
